## Getting started

For Now Lets Take A Test Project Such As...

### mCloud
Basically mCloud Is My Web Host, Yes, Its Owned By Me, A 13 Year Old, You Can Use mCloud For Anything, Except For Scams, It Abuses Our Terms Of Service And We Will Not Tolerate This, The Accounts & The Websites Will Then Be Taken Down. If You Think That Someone Is Doing This Through Our Host, Please Quickly Go Ahead & Leave Me An Email
[Here.](mailto:abuse@the-mcloud.ml)
